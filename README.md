## Project Description
Business and leisure travel to many states or countries can be difficult if you arenâ€™t equipped with the proper attire, or knowledge of specific holidays in that area. The ability to view this information before visiting the region can save the traveler time and effort through pre-planning.  The travel input criteria including: visiting city, start travel date, and end travel date will initialize a server-side API from Calendarific.com, providing them with holiday information as well as useful facts about their destination.  The traveler can also utilize the weather information for that destination, and select the proper clothing or make appropriate plans to adjust for it.  The input data is used to initiate another server-side API from OpenWeathermap.org to provide the weather information.
